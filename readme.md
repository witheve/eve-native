Eve is a programming language based on years of research into building a human-first programming platform. 

**This repository hosts a preview of Eve v0.4 alpha, which is currently under active development. Please don't share the contents of this repository.**

## Getting Started with Eve v0.4 alpha

### From Source

Start by installing [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform, and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) via the `rustup` tool. Use [`rustup`](https://www.rustup.rs) to install the latest ["nightly" build of Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/blob/master/README.md#working-with-nightly-rust):

```sh
rustup install nightly
rustup default nightly
```

Then clone and build the [Eve repository](https://github.com/kodowa/eve-native):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Kodowa/eve-native.git
cd eve-native
npm install
```

You can start an Eve server running a given `*.eve` file:

```sh
cargo run --bin server -- examples/test.eve libraries
```

This builds Eve and runs an Eve server at `localhost:8081`, which hosts the program's output. Each connection will create a new instance of the supplied program(s).

**Note:** running `cargo run` with the `--release` flag will execute 10x - 30x faster, but will take longer to build:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin server -- examples/test.eve libraries
```

## Learning Eve

You can learn about Eve with the following resources:

- [Read the Quick Start Tutorial](http://play.witheve.com/) (use Chrome for best results)
- [Syntax Quick Reference](https://witheve.github.io/assets/docs/SyntaxReference.pdf)
- [Language Handbook (draft)](http://docs.witheve.com)

Also, the [mailing list archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) is a good resource for help and inspiration. In particular, the [Puzzles & Paradoxes series](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/eve-talk/Puzzles$20$26$20Paradoxes%7Csort:date) answers a lot of questions beginners face about the Eve langauge.

## Disclaimer

Eve is currently at a very early, "alpha" stage of development. This means the language, tools, and docs are largely incomplete, but undergoing rapid and continuous development. If you encounter errors while using Eve, don't worry: it's likely our fault. Please bring the problem to our attention by [filing an issue](https://github.com/witheve/eve#how-to-file-an-issue).

As always, with pre-release software, don’t use this for anything important. We are continuously pushing to this codebase, so you can expect very rapid changes. At this time, we’re not prepared make the commitment that our changes will not break your code, but we’ll do our best to [update you](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eve-talk) on the biggest changes.
