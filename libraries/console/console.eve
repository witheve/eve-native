# Console

## Console Log

Logs are written to stdout

search
  [#console/log text]
watch console
  ("log", text)
end

## Console Warn

Warnings are also written to stdout, but are tagged differently

  [#console/warn text]
watch console
  ("warn", text)
end

## Console Error

Errors are written to std-err

search
  [#console/error text]
watch console
  ("error", text)
end

## For the TS side

The TS watcher interface currently relies on passing messages through the websocket watcher

search
  [#console/log text]
watch client/websocket
  ("console/log", text)
end

search
  [#console/warn text]
watch client/websocket
  ("console/warn", text)
end

search
  [#console/error text]
watch client/websocket
  ("console/error", text)
end
